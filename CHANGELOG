Change history for django-storedqueries
-------------------------------------------------------------

?next?
^^^^^^

* Fix an issue where ``get_models()`` takes 3 parameters in older Django, rather than the 2 for 1.11 onwards - ``include_deferred`` was removed.  Introduces a dependency on the ``funcsigs`` package for python2.

0.1.4
^^^^^^

* Changed the ``open`` and ``close`` methods of ``TemporaryTableEditor`` to avoid using the cursor as a context manager for greater compatibility (ie: I have an old internal project where this could be useful)

0.1.3
^^^^^^

* Raise an exception at runtime if the temporary model being passed in delares ``ForeignKey`` etc without setting ``related_name="+"`` for each.
* Add functionality for MySQL to detect if it can use the ``MEMORY`` engine.

0.1.2
^^^^^^
* Initial release
